<figcaption>EWU Libraries wanted to promote a helpful tool for creating bibliographies, Refworks. Refworks was a useful tool that could save students a lot of time and stress but not many students knew about it. The audience for this project was EWU students. We formed groups in TCOM 205 and each group produced a deliverable to help spread the word about Refworks.
